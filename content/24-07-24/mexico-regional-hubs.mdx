# Libertumâ€™s Global Vision: Pioneering Tokenization Across Continents

Today, weâ€™re thrilled to announce a significant milestone in our journey: the establishment of our first regional hub in Mexico.

This move marks the beginning of an ambitious global expansion strategy that will see Libertum become a truly international force in the tokenization revolution.

## Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ â€” The Gateway to Latin America

**Partnership with AV Capital:** Weâ€™ve joined forces with AV Capital, a respected Mexican organization, to create our inaugural regional hub. This partnership combines Libertumâ€™s innovative tokenization technology with AV Capitalâ€™s deep understanding of the local market.

**Regulatory Proactivity:** Weâ€™re actively pursuing an IFPE license for virtual assets and securities trading in Mexico. This proactive approach to regulation demonstrates our commitment to operating within legal frameworks while pushing the boundaries of financial innovation.

**Building Connections:** Our team is engaged in ongoing dialogues with government officials, key industry figures, and local businesses. These relationships are crucial as we position ourselves at the forefront of Mexican tokenization.

**Strategic Location:** Our office in Mexicoâ€™s financial sector is more than just a physical space â€” itâ€™s a symbol of innovation and connectivity, bridging traditional finance with the future of tokenized assets.

## The Power of Regional Focus

**Agility and Local Insight:** By establishing regional hubs, Libertum gains unparalleled agility and local market knowledge. This strategy allows us to adapt quickly to regional needs and capitalize on diversification opportunities.

**Community Engagement:** Our regional approach enables us to build robust community networks, fostering trust and understanding in the markets we serve.

## Our Next Step in Building The Global Tokenization Network

**Latin American Expansion:** Mexico is just the beginning. Our hub here will serve as the regional headquarters for all of Latin America, positioning us to tap into one of the worldâ€™s most dynamic and rapidly growing markets.

**Africa and Thailand on the Horizon:** Looking ahead to 2025, weâ€™re excited to announce plans for two additional regional hubs in Africa and Thailand. These strategic locations will allow us to bring the benefits of tokenization to diverse markets with unique needs and opportunities.

At Libertum, our expansion strategy beginning with Mexico and extending to Africa and Thailand, is more than just geographical growth â€” itâ€™s about creating a truly global ecosystem for tokenized assets.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we invite you to join us. Whether youâ€™re an investor, a business owner, or simply curious about the future of finance, Libertum is creating opportunities for everyone to participate in the tokenization revolution.

Stay tuned as we continue to expand our horizons. We are moving towards unlocking the full potential of tokenization across the globe.
