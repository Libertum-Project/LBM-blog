## Exciting news! 🎉 
## We are thrilled to share our Licensing roadmap for 2024 and 2025. 🗺

🏛 Rome wasn't built in a day! But it was built with global domination in mind. @libertum_token is delighted to provide an update on some of our regulatory achievements, more to follow!!

🏢 With Libertum's comprehensive infrastructure, Real Estate businesses, property owners and other RWA projects, can leverage an end-to-end solution to bring assets on-chain.

We are working with Banco Centralde Reserva de El Salvador and have made significant progress. This process is expected to take another 6-8 months, perfectly aligned with our new CTO’s product roadmap. Additionally, we have applied for a licence for crowdfunding through Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador, which will allow the diversification of our protocols to offer a menu of options to our current and future real estate partners #ElSalvador 

🌎 Why El Salvador? - because we have some very exciting news for you from central and South America. We are super excited about these announcements and know the entire community will definitely be buzzing about it on Monday the 22nd of April - another reason to celebrate Earth's Day & St George's Day.

We have a number of property partners in the EU. To maximise this opportunity we are working with a German partner (soon to be announced) that will accelerate our ability to to tokenize right across 27 EU-Countries. The groundwork for this application is laid, and we expect a positive response within the next 4-5 months - Our initial application will be in Germany, regulated by BaFin. #Germany #Bafin

MiCA has established the framework for digital assets, providing European countries 18 months for implementation. EU nations are actively implementing the framework ahead of schedule. Libertum is working with a globally respected Law firm in Ireland on regulatory compliance to MiFID II and MiCA. Stay tuned for updates as we explore our options, aiming to announce to the community by Q4 2024. 🚀
