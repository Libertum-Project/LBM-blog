# Exploring the Future of Tokenized Real World Assets with Libertum’s CEO Javvad Azam

In the premiere episode of “The Future Podcaster,” host Aavy Suarez delves into the realm of Real World Assets (RWA), blockchain technology, and tokenization with Javvad Azam, Co-Founder and CEO of Liberum.

The conversation covers the challenges and innovations in tokenizing real estate and other assets, offering insights into how blockchain can democratise investment opportunities.

## Introduction to Liberum and Javvad Azam

_Javvad Azam_, a seasoned accountant with over 20 years of experience in hospitality and service sectors, transitioned into the Web 3 space to address financial challenges exacerbated by global conflicts and rising interest rates. His journey into real estate began in 2017, leading to the establishment of a commercial real estate portfolio. However, with the economic shifts, Javvad recognized the need for innovative solutions like tokenization to unlock capital and offer investment opportunities to a broader audience.

## The Challenge of Traditional Real Estate Investment

Javvad highlights the hurdles faced by real estate investors, particularly the high entry barriers and financial strain caused by rising interest rates and inflation. Traditional real estate investment requires significant capital upfront, often locking away substantial funds until the asset is sold. This situation is compounded by high loan-to-value ratios, making it challenging for average individuals to enter the market.

## Tokenization as a Solution

Liberum aims to solve these issues through tokenization, breaking down real estate assets into fractional tokens that can be easily traded and invested in by anyone. This approach not only makes real estate investment accessible but also provides liquidity to otherwise illiquid assets. Javvad emphasizes that tokenization democratizes investment, allowing people to invest in high-value assets with minimal funds, thereby generating passive income.

## Building a Comprehensive Platform

Liberum’s platform offers a fully licensed and scalable infrastructure for tokenizing various asset classes, including real estate, precious metals, commodities, and more. The platform encompasses a primary market for buying and selling tokens, a secondary market for trading, a yield farming protocol for earning returns, and a lending market for borrowing against collateralised tokens.

## Real World Asset Yield Farming

One of the most exciting aspects of Liberum’s offering is the RWA yield farming. This feature allows users to earn yields from tokenized real-world assets, such as real estate and bonds. The gamified method enables users to invest in yield-bearing assets and potentially earn significant returns, with early adopters standing to gain the most.

## Overcoming Protocol Challenges

Javvad discusses the challenges of existing tokenization protocols, particularly their high costs and lack of licensing. Liberum’s approach is to create an affordable, licensed protocol that can be shared with other RWA projects, promoting a more inclusive and cost-effective tokenization ecosystem.

## Future Prospects and Community Involvement

Looking ahead, Liberum aims to expand its tokenization platform and enhance its offerings, continuously improving technology to ensure secure and accessible investment opportunities. Javvad encourages resilience and optimism, urging individuals to embrace new technologies for a better financial future.

## Conclusion

“The Future Podcaster” aims to educate and inform about the advancements in the RWA space, highlighting how tokenization can transform traditional asset investment. With a focus on accessibility and security, Liberum’s platform presents a promising future for democratized investment in real-world assets. As Javvad and Aavy concludes, the transformative potential of blockchain and decentralized finance is just beginning to unfold, inviting everyone to stay curious and stay free.
