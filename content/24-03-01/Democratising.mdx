# Democratising Ownership: Real-World Asset Tokenization with Libertum & KERB

The landscape of asset ownership is undergoing a fascinating transformation. Real-world assets, once confined to traditional methods of ownership, are embracing the power of tokenization.

What tokenization does is transfer ownership to a Smart Contract on a blockchain on pre-agreed terms and allows for tokens of that ownership to be shared amongst the token holders.

The approach facilitates fractionalizing ownership, opening doors to a world of possibilities.

## Benefits of RWA Tokenization:

You can now imagine owning a piece of a vibrant city skyscraper or a rare piece of art and even those amazing commercial properties, all through a secure and transparent digital representation.

This is the essence of real-world asset tokenization, and yet it’s not just about luxury items.

It’s about democratising access to traditionally illiquid assets, fostering greater liquidity, and creating new investment avenues.

## Reimagine Urban Parking

This exciting journey now extends to urban parking tokenization.

The Libertum and KERB partnership is a prime example of how tokenization can be harnessed to address real-world challenges and propel the industry forward.
