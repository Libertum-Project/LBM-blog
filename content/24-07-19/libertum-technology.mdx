## Libertum is charging ahead with the anticipated and detailed 2024 technology milestones update!

We started strong with the $LBM launch on 15th April 2024, amidst a challenging crypto period, but we’re excited about the solid groundwork laid for our future success and token economics.

Many hail LBM’s launch as one of the best in recent history, and our focus remains on adding even more value.

Now, we’re delighted to reveal our meticulously planned 2024 technology milestones. This roadmap isn’t just a series of checkpoints; it’s our blueprint for revolutionising your interaction with financial markets. From democratising lending to enabling 24/7 global trading, each milestone signifies a step towards financial freedom for all.

Blockchain Development: Our team is pushing boundaries to create a blockchain-enabled asset-agnostic tokenization ecosystem that ensures scalability. This platform will facilitate seamless tokenization of diverse assets and implement advanced consensus mechanisms to uphold our network’s integrity. Smart contracts for tokenization, marketplace, lending market, and farming market are expected to be completed by the end of September before undergoing an audit by SolidProof_io

## Frontend Innovation:

*_Marketplace_* — The primary market is built, and we’re white labelling the technology to become the ‘Shopify’ of RWA with drag and drop option for various RWA projects.

*_Lending Market_* — Wireframe and design completed, with frontend development starting next week.

*_Farming Market_*— Wireframe done, designer working on figma designs for completion by mid Aug. Frontend modelling to follow.
