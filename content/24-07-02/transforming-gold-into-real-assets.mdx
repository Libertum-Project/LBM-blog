## Transforming Gold into Liquid Assets: Libertum’s Vision for the Indian Market

Libertum’s blockchain solution to India’s $1.5 trillion gold market.

**The Worth of Gold in India**

Indian households reportedly hold an astounding 21,000 tonnes of gold, surpassing even the World Bank’s reserves. This gold, valued at billions of dollars, is a stable store of value and a significant part of the global gold market.

At the end of 2022, the total household wealth in India stood at over 16 trillion U.S. dollars, up from over 14 trillion in 2021. Each household are reputed to hold 8%-10% of their wealth in Gold. So you can imagine 10% of 16 trillion is a huge tokenisation pool to be at the forefront of.

**Our Partnership in India**

We are partnering with a prominent Indian enterprise, soon to be announced, which will act as the custodian of the physical gold for our tokenization process. This partnership ensures that the gold backing our tokens is securely stored and managed.

**The Tokenization Process**

- **Custodian Value:** The chosen custodian will manage and safeguard the physical gold.
- **Tokenization:** The gold is tokenized, allowing investors to buy, sell, and trade gold-backed tokens with ease.
- **Liquidity:** This process transforms physical gold into a liquid asset, providing investors with the flexibility to trade without the need for physical exchange.

**Sentimental Value of Gold in India**

Gold holds a unique place in the hearts of Indians, transcending economic classes. From the super-rich to the middle class and even the poor, gold is cherished as a secure investment and a symbol of wealth and stability. This deep-rooted cultural affinity towards gold makes it an ideal candidate for tokenization, ensuring widespread acceptance and participation.

**Why Gold is Deeply Engrained in the Indian Psyche**

The Indian preference for physical gold is often attributed to a risk-averse mentality, where gold is seen as a safer and more tangible store of value compared to financial instruments. This cultural and economic sentiment towards gold provides a strong foundation for our tokenization efforts.

Libertum is pioneering the transformation of the Indian gold market by converting billions of dollars’ worth of gold into liquid assets. Our innovative process, coupled with strategic partnerships, is set to revolutionize the way Indians invest in gold, making it more accessible, secure, and flexible. The future of gold investment is here, and Libertum is leading the charge.
