## Libertum’s Step-by-Step Guide to Tokenize Real Estate

In this guide, let’s delve into Libertum’s step-by-step process of how to tokenize real estate, opening up exciting opportunities for a broader range of investors.

🏢 **Step 1: Property Selection and Valuation for Tokenizing Real Estate**
Libertum will collaborate with asset owners to select a suitable property and conduct a thorough valuation to determine fair market value. This crucial step sets the value for the digital tokens to be issued.

📜 **Step 2: Establishing a Legal Structure and Ensuring Compliance**
Consulting legal experts to set up a compliant structure, such as a special purpose vehicle (SPV), is essential. Compliance with local and international regulations is key in the tokenization process.

🔍 **Step 3: Conducting Due Diligence on the Property**
Libertum performs comprehensive due diligence, including background checks and property inspections, to verify the property’s legality and ownership history. This ensures legitimacy in tokenizing the property.

💼 **Step 4: Token Creation for Real Estate Tokenization**
Libertum creates a smart contract on a blockchain platform to represent the property and tokens, defining ownership rules.

🚀 **Step 5: Launching a Token Offering**
Plan and execute a token offering to attract potential investors interested in real estate tokens. Marketing efforts will be crucial in promoting the offering.

🔒 **Step 6: Performing KYC/AML Checks**
Libertum conducts Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks to ensure compliance with regulatory standards before investors participate in the token offering.

🏢 **Step 7: Token Distribution for Tokenized Real Estate**
After completing the token offering and all KYC/AML checks, Libertum will distribute the tokens to investors’ blockchain wallets, marking the successful end of the real estate tokenization process.

💹 **Step 8: Enabling Secondary Market Trading**
Libertum facilitates trading of the tokens on its secondary markets to enhance liquidity and price discovery, a key advantage of real estate asset tokenization.

🏠 **Step 9: Managing the Property and Distributing Income**
To effectively manage tokenized real estate, Libertum handles tasks like maintenance, leasing, and rent collection. Rental income or profits from the property are distributed to token holders.

📊 **Step 10: Ongoing Reporting and Compliance for Tokenized Real Estate**
Libertum ensures continuous compliance with regulations by handling financial reporting, tax filings, and audits. This step upholds the legitimacy and sustainability of investments in tokenized real estate.
